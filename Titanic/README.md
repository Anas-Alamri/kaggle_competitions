# Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

### Problem Statement

**When boarding a ship we start to think about safety.The terrifiying accident that happened to the titanic will always be one of the most tragic accidents in history. The titanic is the largest moving object ever built. It was the most luxurious liner of her era -- the "ship of dreams" -- which ultimately carried over 1,500 people to their death in the ice cold waters of the North Atlantic in the early hours of April 15, 1912.**


**This is a study to analyze what affected the survivel rate outcome.Of the estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard the Titanic when it struck an iceberg and sank on April 15, 1912, some 1,500 died in the cold waters of the North Atlantic. A mere 700 people lived on.We were given labeled data containing information about approximatly 1300 passanges that were on the titanic.We will analyze the features of the passengers to try and predict who survived this accident.**
